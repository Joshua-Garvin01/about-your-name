    <h1>Hello, My name is Joshua Garvin.</h1>
    <p>I am an Eagle Scout and have spent a lot of time outdoors. Weather it be hiking canoeing or even backpacking, I'm always up for a fun challenge</p>
    <p>I'm also a huge nerd and tend to spend way too much time playing video games. However I mostly just play video games to spend time with friends.</p>

    <p>And this is my dog Lilly. She is a goofball who barks a lot but is too cute to be mad at.</p>
